Loading Word2Vec model...
This program uses an SPA network in Nengo to perform vector operations on a semantically structured word-vector space *learned* from a sentence corpus.
When trained on a large corpus of English sentences, for example, it should produce: Vector[king] - Vector[man] + Vector[woman] = Vector[king]
For now, it just does subtraction...
